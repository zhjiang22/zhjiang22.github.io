I am a 3rd-year CSE Ph.D. student in [ARISE Lab](http://ariselab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Michael R. Lyu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn), in 2022.

My research interests lie in the reliability of large-scale cloud systems and LLM systems. Currently, my primary focus is on automated analysis and operations utilizing heterogeneous data, e.g., logs, traces, metrics and alerts.

*I always welcome the opportunity to collaborate and discuss research topics. Feel free to drop me an email if you're interested in connecting with me.* ðŸ˜ƒ



<!-- I am also a maintainer of [LogPAI](https://github.com/logpai) project, an open-source framework for automated log analysis. -->
