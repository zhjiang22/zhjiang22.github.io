    LLM-as-a-Service platforms handle millions of daily requests and must meet low-latency, SLO, and efficiency goals, but conventional cloud managers falter under LMaaSâ€™s dynamic, bursty workloads.
    We introduce a hierarchical-prediction management framework that pairs a coarse-grained service-workload predictor with a fine-grained request-load predictor to build per-instance load anticipators.
    By fusing long- and short-term forecasts, it proactively auto-scales resources and routes requests based on current and anticipated load, preventing under-/over-provisioning and instance load imbalancing.
