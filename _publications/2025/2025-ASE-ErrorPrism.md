    Reliability management in cloud service systems is challenging due to the cascading effect of failures.
    Error wrapping, a practice prevalent in modern microservice development, enriches errors with context at each layer of the function call stack, constructing an error chain that describes a failure from its technical origin to its business impact.
    However, this also presents a significant traceability problem when recovering the complete error propagation path from the final log message back to its source. Existing approaches are ineffective at addressing this problem.
    To fill this gap, we present ErrorPrism for automated reconstruction of error propagation paths in production microservice systems by integrating static analysis and an LLM agent.
