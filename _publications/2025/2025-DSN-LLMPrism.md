    Multi-tenant large-scale LLM training platforms have been built to offer LLM training services, while performance issues occur frequently and can result in substantial resource wastage. The limited visibility from the perspective of platform providers impedes existing profiling methods and poses challenges to the performance monitoring and diagnosis of LLM training jobs.
    This paper proposes LLMPrism, the first black-box performance diagnosis solution for LLM training platforms by utilizing underlying network flow data and the distinct characteristics in the LLM training procedure. By progressively recognizing LLM training jobs, identifying their parallelism strategies, and reconstructing the training timelines, LLMPrism achieves non-intrusive, lightweight, and continuous monitoring of LLM training systems.
