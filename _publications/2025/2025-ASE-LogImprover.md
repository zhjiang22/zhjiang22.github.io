    High-quality logging is critical for the reliability of cloud services, yet the industrial process for improving it is typically manual, reactive, and unscalable.
    Existing automated tools inherit this reactive nature, failing to answer the crucial whether-to-log question and are constrained to simple logging statement insertion, thus addressing only a fraction of the real-world logging improvement.
    To address these gaps and cope with logging debt in large-scale codebases, we propose LogImprover, a framework powered by LLMs that automates proactive logging quality improvement and introduce two paradigm shifts: from reactive generation to proactive discovery, and from simple insertion to holistic logging patch generation.
