    Effective alert diagnosis is essential for ensuring the reliability of large-scale online service systems.
    While various automated tools have been proposed, they struggle in practice due to alert-agnostic log scoping and the inability to organize complex data effectively for reasoning.
    To overcome these limitations, we introduce LogPilot, an intent-aware and scalable log-based framework powered by LLMs for automated alert diagnosis.
