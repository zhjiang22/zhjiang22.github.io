    While the sheer volume of operational documentation required for managing complex cloud services hinders efficient knowledge acquisition, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a streamlined solution by retrieving relevant knowledge to generate concise, referenced answers.
    However, deploying a reliable RAG-based chatbot for cloud operation remains a challenge.
    In this experience paper, we first analyze the development and deployment of RAG-based chatbots for operational question answering (OpsQA) at a large-scale cloud vendor.
    Base on the findings, we propose iKnow, an intent-guided RAG-based chatbot that integrates intent detection, query rewriting tailored to each intent, and missing knowledge detection to enhance answer quality.
