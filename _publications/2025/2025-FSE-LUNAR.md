    Log parsing is a critical prerequisite for many log analysis tasks. However, existing language model-based parsers often rely heavily on high-quality labeled examples to perform well, which limits their practicality in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose LUNAR, an unsupervised, LLM-based method for efficient and ready-to-use log parsing, which is based on the key insight that while LLMs struggle with direct log parsing, their performance can be significantly improved through comparative analysis of multiple logs that differ only in their parameter components.
