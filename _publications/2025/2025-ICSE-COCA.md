    Automatically identifying the root cause of runtime failures is critical for ensuring the reliability of distributed systems.
    However, prevailing automatic RCA approaches rely on comprehensive runtime monitoring data, which is often not fully available in issue platforms.
    To obtain more accurate and comprehensive RCA results, we propose COCA, a code knowledge enhanced RCA approach for issue reports.
