  To improve observability of large-scale cloud systems, we propose to infer <i>functional clusters</i>, i.e., groups of instances having similar functionalities, to bridge the gap betwwen instance and service layer.
  Our pilot study demonstrates that instances having similar functionalities share similar <i>communication</i> and <i>resource usage</i> patterns. 
  Motivated by these findings, we propose a non-intrusive solution, <em>Prism</em>, to reveal functional clusters in cloud systems based on communication traces and performance metrics.
