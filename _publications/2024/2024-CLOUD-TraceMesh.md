abstract: >-
    Distributed tracing is a fundamental monitoring tool for cloud systems; however, it typically captures overlapping and redundant information.
    Existing tail-based trace samplers fall short of considering the <i>high-dimensional</i> and <i>dynamic</i> nature of trace data.
    To address these practical challenges, we introduce TraceMesh, a scalable and streaming sampler for distributed traces, which adapts to evolving trace features and dynamically samples uncommon traces.
