    Logs are crucial for maintaining online service systems, but manual investigation of logs by engineers is labor-intensive and prone to errors.
    We find that engineers typically prioritize two categories of log information for diagnosis: <i>fault-indicating descriptions</i> (FID) that highlight abnormal events, and <i> fault-indicating parameters </i> (FIP) that identify associated entities.
    Motivated by these findings, we propose Log4d, a two-stage approach with novel prompt-based tuning to automatically extract fault-indicating information from logs for fault diagnosis.
