    Logging practices have been extensively studied to assist developers in writing logging statements.
    However, existing automatic logging methods with single-method contexts face three key limitations: <i>limited static scope</i>, <i>inconsistent logging styles</i>, and <i>missing variables type information</i>.
    To tackle these limitations, we propose SCLogger, the first approach to generate contextualized logging statements using large language models with inter-method static contexts.
