    Log parsing is essential for converting unstructured logs into structured data for automated analysis.
    Evaluating the characteristics and performance of various log parsers is crucial, however, the existing Loghub dataset is limited in <i>scale</i> and <i>representativeness</i>.
    We introduce Loghub-2.0, comprising 14 datasets with an average of 3.6 million logs each. Based on these datasets, we thoroughly re-evaluate 15 state-of-the-art log parsers in a more rigorous and practical setting, offering valuable insights.
