    Postmortem analysis is essential for managing cloud system incidents, involving profiling incidents to classify them into unique fault patterns.
    Current manual approaches are labor-intensive and error-prone, resulting in only the most severe incidents being analyzed, which leads to a skewed fault pattern overview.
    To address these limitations, we propose an automated approach called FaultProfIT, for <u>Fault</u> Pattern <u>Prof</u>iling of <u>I</u>ncident <u>T</u>ickets, utilizing hierarchy-guided contrastive learning.
