    Despite advancements in natural language generation and programming language comprehension, the potential of large language models (LLMs) for generating logging statements remains unexplored.
    To fill the gap, we conduct the first study on LLMs for logging statement generation.
    We create a logging statement generation dataset and evaluate the <i>effectiveness</i> and <i>generalization capabilities</i> of 13 top-performing LLMs.
    Our empirical analysis reveals the limitations of current logging methods, highlights the promise of LLM-based logging tools, and offers actionable guidance for developing more practical models.
